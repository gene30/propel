# Propel v1.3

Propel is a web-scraper for Reddit. v1.3 includes JSON support . Currently you can change the websites.txt to any subreddit and it will display all of the most recent reddit posts in that subreddit in a JSON file. Front-end code will be made for this project in upcoming releases. 


- Newest Update -
  - JSON is now exported and the post title, link, and subreddit are displayed in the JSON for each post. It encompasses the newest posts from the subreddit that you put in the websites.txt
