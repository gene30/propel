# Propel v1.01

Propel is a web-scraper for Reddit. In the future it will export to a CSV, and/or a JSON. Currently you can change the websites.txt to any subreddit and it will display all of the most recent reddit posts in that subreddit. The authors are under them (in order) for now but a patch is on the way.
