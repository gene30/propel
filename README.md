# Propel v1.2

Propel is a web-scraper for Reddit. In the future it will export to a CSV, and/or a JSON. Currently you can change the websites.txt to any subreddit and it will display all of the most recent reddit posts in that subreddit.


- Newest Update -
  - It currently displays the Title of the most recent post in the subreddit (chosen by the websites.txt file), and fetches the title and comments link, preparing to export to csv/json.
